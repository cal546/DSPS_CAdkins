What it is. A plotting of temperature vs time of the plasma measured by a lagmeir probe on a sounding rocket

Before: The legend covers some of the data and the the points are all together in one mass

After: The legend was moved up a bit to cover less of the data by increasing the y-axis. The data points were given transperency to make out what is happening using an alpha of 0.5. Title changed to remove chart junk.
